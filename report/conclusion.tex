Seen the results, the feasibility of a simple localization has been proved, as long as the proper noise reduction algorithm is chosen. The limited available amount of time didn't allow us to assess more sophisticated algorithms such as LMS and AED. Additionaly, we would have also liked to be able to implement localization algorithms (Crossing Lines and Steered-response power) and to be able to track the evolution of the whale.
