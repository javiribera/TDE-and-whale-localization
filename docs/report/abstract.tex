Time Delay Estimation (TDE) is a widely studied research topic which has many applications, specially in target localization and tracking. This article presents a MATLAB implementation and comparison of some algorithms used to do so, with emphasis on their impact on accuracy of the results in an underwater environment. A handy GUI was also developed to assist in visual comparison of algorithms and preprocessing filters. Finally, a simple crossing-lines method was used to try to localize the target. The considered case-study has been a recording from PMRF, an instrumented US Navy testing range located off the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The raw data was collected from seven bottom mounted hydrophones in deep water approximately 45 km northwest of Kauai. Targets were always minke whales.
